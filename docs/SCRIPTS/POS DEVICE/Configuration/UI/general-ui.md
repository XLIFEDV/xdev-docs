General UI settings control the **basic look and feel** and overall UI behavior.

## What belongs here?

- UI open/close animations (if configurable)
- Sound effects toggles (if you add them)
- UI scale / responsive rules (if configurable)
- General UI timing values (if configurable)

## Recommended documentation style

When you add UI options, always include:

- **What the user sees**
- **What changes when you tweak it**
- **Screenshot/gif** (later)
- **Example config**

:::tip
If you later add image support in docs, place images in `/static/img/...` and reference them in markdown.
