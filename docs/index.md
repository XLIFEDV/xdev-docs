## Welcome

This documentation provides comprehensive information about **XDEVELOPMENT products**, including both **scripts** and **vehicle packs**.

The goal of this documentation is to help users:
- Understand how products work
- Install and configure them correctly
- Learn usage details and advanced behaviors
- Find integration notes and technical references when needed

This is not a marketing page — it is a **technical reference** designed for developers and server owners.

## What You’ll Find Here

The documentation is structured into multiple sections based on product type and usage.

### Scripts

Script documentation focuses on:
- Installation steps
- Configuration options
- UI behavior and customization
- Events, exports, and integrations
- Framework compatibility (QB / ESX where applicable)

Each script has its own section with detailed breakdowns instead of a single long README.

---

### Vehicle Packs

Vehicle-related documentation may include:
- Installation and resource structure
- Required dependencies
- Handling and tuning notes
- Optional features or extras
- Usage guidelines and known limitations

Vehicle packs may also contain additional technical notes depending on the complexity of the pack.

## How to Use This Documentation

- Use the **left sidebar** to navigate between products and sections.
- Each product is documented independently.
- Configuration-heavy topics are split into smaller pages for clarity.
